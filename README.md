GoodGrub is the way to track your diet. Track your meals and health alongside each other. Earn Hedera TinyBar rewards for your healthy habits. Better Food, Better Future.
</p>

GoodGrub offers a solution to tracking your food intake - allowing you to log each meal you eat.

It may sound simple but GoodGrub takes a twist on a traditional food diary, making it a simple, no-nonsense, consistent and rewarding experience.

GoodGrub Supports logging in with Google - this makes it simple to login easily and get started, with no additional setup necessary! It also has a very simple easy to use interface to support easy logging of meals, making it accessible to all. Every meal logged provides an incentive to keep using GoodGrub - you get 3 Hedera TinyBar with each meal logged and it takes 0 extra effort from the user. GoodGrub generates a Hedera account for the user and assigns it to them - meaning that they don't have to do anything more than log their diet to earn the incentive - an important step to making the platform accessible to all.

GoodGrub is free - this is seen throughout all features and makes it accessible to all, meaning it is easy for anyone to keep track of their diet.

The strength GoodGrub truly has is allowing users to track their feelings alongside their meals - this allows users to notice patterns in how different foods affect their health, both physically and mentally. This feature will allow for people to improve their future's, being able to easier identify patterns early on and therefore reduce the affects of their diet on their health.

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the by modifying `src/pages/`. The pages auto-update as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
